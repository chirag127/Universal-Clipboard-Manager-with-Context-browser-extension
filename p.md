Okay, here is a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the "Universal Clipboard Manager with Context" browser extension, incorporating the specified tech stack.

Product Requirements Document: Universal Clipboard Manager with Context (UCMC)

1. Introduction

The Universal Clipboard Manager with Context (UCMC) is a browser extension designed to enhance user productivity by providing a persistent, searchable, and context-aware clipboard history. Unlike basic clipboard managers, UCMC automatically captures the source URL (when available) of copied content and utilizes AI (via a backend service) to categorize items, making retrieval faster and more intuitive. This solves the common problem of losing track of copied information or its origin, especially during research, coding, or content creation workflows.

2. Goals & Objectives

Improve Productivity: Reduce the time users spend searching for previously copied information or its source.

Enhance Context: Provide users with the origin (URL) of copied web content for better recall and referencing.

Intelligent Organization: Automatically categorize clipboard items using AI to facilitate filtering and understanding.

Seamless Integration: Offer a non-intrusive user experience that integrates smoothly into the user's browsing workflow.

Reliable History: Provide a persistent and easily accessible log of copied text content.

3. Target Audience

Knowledge Workers: Researchers, writers, analysts who gather information from various web sources.

Developers: Programmers copying code snippets, error messages, URLs, and configurations.

Students: Individuals gathering information for assignments and projects.

Content Creators: Bloggers, social media managers, marketers compiling content.

Anyone who frequently copies and pastes text content from the web.

4. Features & Functional Requirements

MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Scope:

Feature ID	Feature Name	User Story	Functional Requirements	Priority
F-01	Clipboard History Capture	As a user, I want the extension to automatically save text I copy within my browser, so I don't lose it.	- Automatically detect and capture text/plain clipboard copy events initiated within the browser context.<br>- Store captured text content.<br>- Store timestamp of capture.	Must Have
F-02	Source URL Tracking	As a user, I want the extension to save the URL of the page I copied text from, so I know its origin.	- When text is copied from a web page, capture the document.URL of the active tab.<br>- Associate the URL with the corresponding clipboard entry.<br>- Handle cases where URL isn't available (e.g., browser UI, other extensions).	Must Have
F-03	History Access UI	As a user, I want to easily open a list of my recent clipboard items, so I can view and reuse them.	- Provide a browser action (toolbar icon) that opens a popup UI.<br>- Display a list of recent clipboard items (e.g., last 20), showing content preview, source URL (if available), and timestamp.	Must Have
F-04	Re-copy Item	As a user, I want to click an item in the history UI to copy it back to my clipboard, so I can paste it.	- Clicking an item entry in the popup UI should copy its text content back to the system clipboard.<br>- Provide visual feedback upon successful copy.	Must Have
F-05	Basic Search	As a user, I want to search my clipboard history by keyword, so I can find specific items quickly.	- Include a search input field in the popup UI.<br>- Filter the displayed history list based on text content matching the search query (case-insensitive).	Must Have
F-06	Delete Item	As a user, I want to delete individual items from my history, so I can manage clutter.	- Provide a mechanism (e.g., delete icon) next to each item in the list to remove it permanently from storage.	Must Have
F-07	Backend AI Categorization	As a user, I want my copied items to be automatically categorized (e.g., Code, URL, Address), so I can understand and filter them better.	- On text capture (F-01), send the text content to the backend API.<br>- Backend uses Gemini API to classify the text into predefined categories (e.g., Code, Address, URL, Email, Quote, Plain Text).<br>- Store the returned category with the clipboard entry.<br>- Display the category visually in the History Access UI (F-03).	High
F-08	Filter by Category	As a user, I want to filter my history by the AI-generated categories, so I can find specific types of items.	- Provide UI elements (e.g., dropdown, buttons) in the popup to filter the history view by the AI categories (F-07).	High
F-09	Filter by Source (Domain)	As a user, I want to filter my history by the website domain I copied from, so I can find items from specific sources.	- Provide UI elements to filter the history view based on the domain part of the stored source URL (F-02).	Medium
F-10	Clear All History	As a user, I want an option to clear my entire clipboard history, so I can start fresh or manage privacy.	- Provide a "Clear All" button within the UI (perhaps in a settings area) with a confirmation step.	Medium

Post-MVP / Future Considerations:

Image Support: Capture and display copied images.

Cross-Device Sync: Sync clipboard history across browsers/devices using user accounts.

Rich Formatting: Preserve basic text formatting (bold, italic) where possible.

Application Source Tracking: Investigate feasibility of identifying the source application (very difficult/likely impossible in standard browser extensions due to sandboxing, but worth noting as a desired state).

Advanced Filtering: Filter by date range.

Favorites/Pinning: Mark important items for easy access.

Inline Editing: Allow editing of copied text within the history UI.

More AI Features: Summarization of long text, keyword extraction.

Offline Support: Ensure core functionality (capture, view local history) works offline. AI features require connectivity.

Keyboard Shortcuts: Configurable shortcut to open the history popup.

5. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance:

The extension must have minimal impact on browser performance (CPU, memory).

Clipboard capture should be instantaneous and not interfere with the user's copy action.

Popup UI should load quickly (< 500ms).

Backend API calls for AI categorization should be asynchronous and not block the UI. Response time TBD based on Gemini API performance.

Security:

All communication between the extension and the backend must use HTTPS.

Clipboard data sent to the backend must be handled securely and adhere to a strict privacy policy. Consider potential sensitivity of clipboard contents.

No sensitive user credentials should be stored unless implementing user accounts for sync (post-MVP), in which case industry best practices (hashing, secure storage) must be followed.

Adhere to Manifest V3 security principles (reduced remote code execution, service worker lifetime management).

Privacy:

Provide a clear and accessible privacy policy detailing what data is collected (clipboard text, source URL), how it's used (storage, AI categorization), and where it's sent (backend server, potentially Google via Gemini API).

Users must be informed about the AI categorization feature and the data transfer it entails.

Provide controls to manage data (delete items, clear history).

Usability:

The UI should be intuitive and easy to navigate.

Core actions (viewing history, re-copying, searching) should be straightforward.

Provide clear feedback for actions (e.g., item copied, item deleted).

Reliability:

Clipboard capture should work consistently across various websites.

Data storage should be persistent and reliable (using chrome.storage or IndexedDB locally, MongoDB on the backend).

Gracefully handle errors (e.g., backend unavailable, AI API errors).

Compatibility:

Target latest versions of major browsers supporting Manifest V3 (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge). Firefox support may require adjustments.

Scalability (Backend):

The Express.js backend and MongoDB database should be designed to handle a growing number of users and clipboard entries, especially if sync is implemented later.

6. Design & User Experience (UX)

UI: Clean, simple, and compact popup interface. Consistent visual style. Consider light/dark mode support.

Interaction: Primarily through the browser action popup. Minimal background intrusion.

Feedback: Visual cues for copy success, deletion, loading states (especially for AI categorization if not instant).

(Optional): Wireframes/Mockups should be created to visualize the popup UI, list items, search/filter controls.

10. Open Issues / Questions

Application Source Tracking: Confirm the near-impossibility of reliably tracking non-browser application sources due to OS/browser security limitations. Set expectations accordingly.

Gemini API: Evaluate latency, rate limits, cost, and reliability of the specific experimental model. Have fallback logic if the API fails (e.g., store as "Uncategorized").

Privacy Review: Conduct a thorough privacy review, especially concerning sending potentially sensitive clipboard data to the backend/AI. Ensure compliance with browser store policies.

Handling Large Content: Define limits or strategies for handling extremely large copied text items (performance, storage, API limits).

Content Script Strategy: Determine the optimal strategy for detecting copy events and grabbing the URL reliably (e.g., background listener vs. injecting content scripts on demand).

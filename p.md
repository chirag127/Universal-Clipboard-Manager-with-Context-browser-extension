Okay, here is a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the "Universal Clipboard Manager with Context" browser extension, detailing the final product specifications based on your requirements.

Product Requirements Document: Universal Clipboard Manager with Context (Codename: ClipContext)

Version: 1.0 (Final Product)
Date: October 26, 2023
Author: [Your Name/AI Assistant]

1. Introduction

ClipContext is a browser extension designed to enhance user productivity by providing a persistent, searchable, and context-aware clipboard history. It automatically captures items copied within the browser, remembers their source (URL and page title), and utilizes AI to categorize the content, making retrieval intuitive and efficient. This eliminates the frustration of losing copied items or their original context.

2. Goals

Provide users with a reliable and easily accessible history of items copied within the browser.

Retain the context (source URL, page title) for each copied item.

Enable fast searching and filtering of clipboard history based on content, source, and AI-determined category.

Leverage AI (Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental 01-21) to automatically categorize clipboard content for better organization.

Offer a seamless and performant user experience integrated directly into the browser.

Ensure user privacy and data security throughout the process.

3. Target Audience

Developers: Quickly retrieve code snippets, URLs, configuration lines.

Writers & Researchers: Manage quotes, references, links, and notes gathered during research.

Students: Organize information copied from various online sources for assignments.

Support Agents & Customer Service: Access frequently used text snippets, links, or instructions.

General Power Users: Anyone who frequently copies and pastes information and struggles with managing their clipboard history or remembering the source.

4. Functional Requirements

4.1. Clipboard Monitoring & Data Capture
* FR4.1.1: The extension's background service worker must monitor clipboard copy events initiated within the browser environment.
* FR4.1.2: Upon detecting a copy event, the extension must capture the copied content.
* Supported Content Type: Text (Plain text, formatted text preserved as plain text).
* Supported Content Type: Images (Capture images copied within the browser, e.g., via right-click -> "Copy Image"). Store efficiently (details in Tech Specs).
* FR4.1.3: For each captured item, the extension must automatically record:
* The content itself.
* A precise timestamp (UTC) of when the copy event occurred.
* The URL of the active tab where the copy event occurred.
* The Title of the active tab where the copy event occurred.
* The Content Type (e.g., 'text', 'image').
* FR4.1.4: The captured data (content, timestamp, URL, title, type) must be securely sent to the backend for storage and processing.
* FR4.1.5: A unique, anonymous user identifier (generated by the extension and stored in chrome.storage.local or equivalent) must be associated with each entry sent to the backend to keep user data separate without requiring explicit login.

4.2. Backend Storage & Processing
* FR4.2.1: The Express.js backend must provide secure API endpoints for receiving, storing, retrieving, and deleting clipboard entries.
* FR4.2.2: All clipboard data received from the extension must be stored persistently in the MongoDB database, associated with the unique user identifier.
* FR4.2.3: Upon receiving a new text-based clipboard entry, the backend must asynchronously call the Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental 01-21 API to categorize the content.
* FR4.2.4: The backend must handle potential errors during the API call to Gemini (e.g., rate limits, network errors, invalid responses) gracefully, potentially marking the item as 'Uncategorized'.
* FR4.2.5: The AI-determined category must be stored alongside the clipboard entry in MongoDB. Defined categories include:
* Code Snippet
* URL
* Email Address
* Phone Number
* Physical Address
* Quote (longer blocks of prose)
* Image
* Plain Text (default/fallback for uncategorized text)
* FR4.2.6: The backend must implement logic for data retention limits defined in the settings (see FR4.4.3). Old entries exceeding the limit should be automatically pruned.

4.3. Extension Popup UI & Interaction
* FR4.3.1: Clicking the extension icon in the browser toolbar must open a popup window displaying the clipboard history.
* FR4.3.2: The popup must display a list of recent clipboard items, ordered chronologically (newest first).
* FR4.3.3: Each list item must clearly display:
* A preview of the content (truncated if necessary, with full view on hover/click). For images, show a thumbnail.
* The source Favicon and Page Title (or URL if title is unavailable).
* An icon or tag representing the AI-determined category.
* A relative timestamp (e.g., "5 mins ago", "2 hours ago").
* FR4.3.4: The list must be scrollable to view older history items, loading more items dynamically as the user scrolls down (infinite scroll).
* FR4.3.5: A prominent search bar must be present at the top of the popup. Typing in the search bar must filter the displayed history in real-time based on matching content.
* FR4.3.6: Filter controls must be available to refine the history view by:
* AI Category (checkboxes or dropdown).
* Content Type (Text / Image).
* Date Range (Predefined: Today, Last 7 days, Last 30 days; Custom range picker).
* Source Domain (potentially auto-populated based on history).
* Favorites (see FR4.3.8).
* Filters must be combinable (e.g., "Code Snippets" from "github.com" in the "Last 7 days").
* FR4.3.7: Each item in the list must have interactive elements allowing the user to:
* Copy: Click a button to copy the item back to the system clipboard.
* Delete: Click a button to permanently delete the item from the history (with confirmation).
* Favorite: Click a star/heart icon to toggle its favorite status.
* View Source: Click the source information to open the original URL in a new tab.
* FR4.3.8: Favorited items should be visually distinct and persist until unfavorited. A dedicated "Favorites" filter must be available.
* FR4.3.9: The popup must provide access to the Settings page (see FR4.4).
* FR4.3.10: Keyboard navigation must be supported within the popup for accessibility (tabbing through elements, enter to activate, arrow keys for list navigation).

4.4. Settings & Management
* FR4.4.1: A dedicated settings page/section within the popup or on a separate options page must be accessible.
* FR4.4.2: Enable/Disable History: Users must be able to temporarily pause or permanently disable clipboard history collection.
* FR4.4.3: History Limit: Users must be able to configure the maximum history retention based on:
* Number of items (e.g., 100, 500, 1000, Unlimited).
* Duration (e.g., 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, Unlimited).
* FR4.4.4: Clear History: A button must allow users to permanently delete their entire clipboard history (with strong confirmation).
* FR4.4.5: AI Categorization Toggle: Users must be able to disable the AI categorization feature (e.g., for privacy reasons or to reduce API calls). Items copied while disabled will be marked 'Uncategorized' or 'Plain Text'.
* FR4.4.6: Data Export: Provide an option to export the entire clipboard history (associated with the user's ID) to a standard format like JSON or CSV.
* FR4.4.7: Data Import: Provide an option to import history from a previously exported file (matching the export format).
* FR4.4.8: Display Unique ID: Show the anonymous unique user ID for troubleshooting or associating exported data.
* FR4.4.9: Privacy Policy Link: Provide a clear link to the product's privacy policy.

4.5. Security & Privacy
* FR4.5.1: The extension must request only necessary permissions (e.g., clipboardRead, storage, activeTab, scripting, potentially favicon permission if fetching favicons directly). Manifest V3 guidelines must be strictly followed.
* FR4.5.2: All communication between the extension frontend and the backend API must use HTTPS.
* FR4.5.3: The backend must sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks (NoSQL injection, etc.).
* FR4.5.4: API keys (e.g., for Gemini) must be stored securely on the backend and never exposed in the frontend code.
* FR4.5.5: User clipboard data must be treated as sensitive. It should only be stored for the purpose of providing the history feature and should not be shared or used for any other purpose. Access controls on the backend must prevent data leakage between users.
* FR4.5.6: The anonymous user ID should not be easily linkable to any personally identifiable information unless the user explicitly provides it elsewhere.

5. Non-Functional Requirements

NF5.1. Performance:

The extension's background processes must have minimal impact on browser performance (CPU, memory).

The popup UI must load quickly (< 500ms).

Searching and filtering must feel instantaneous (< 300ms for typical history sizes).

Backend API response times should be optimized (< 500ms for reads, writes may be slightly longer due to AI processing). Asynchronous AI processing should not block writes.

NF5.2. Reliability:

The extension must function reliably across browser restarts and updates.

Backend service must maintain high uptime (e.g., > 99.9%).

Graceful handling of network errors or API failures (e.g., display message to user, retry mechanism for AI categorization).

NF5.3. Scalability:

The backend infrastructure (Express.js, MongoDB) must be able to handle a significant number of users and a large volume of clipboard entries per user. Database indexing must be implemented effectively (e.g., on userId, timestamp, category).

Rate limiting should be implemented on the backend API to prevent abuse and manage costs (especially for the Gemini API).

NF5.4. Usability:

The interface must be intuitive and require minimal learning curve.

Visual feedback must be provided for user actions (e.g., successful copy, delete).

Consistent design language throughout the UI.

NF5.5. Maintainability:

Codebase (frontend and backend) must be well-structured, commented, and follow best practices to facilitate future updates and bug fixing.

Clear separation between extension/ and backend/ folders.

NF5.6. Accessibility:

The extension popup UI should adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines where applicable, including keyboard navigation, focus indicators, sufficient color contrast, and compatibility with screen readers.

NF5.7. Security:

Regular security audits or reviews of both frontend and backend code. Dependency vulnerability scanning implemented.

6. Design & UX Considerations

Popup Design: Clean, modern aesthetic. Prioritize content visibility. Consider light and dark mode themes based on OS/browser settings.

Visual Cues: Use distinct icons for categories, favorites, and actions. Use favicons effectively for source identification.

Information Density: Balance showing sufficient information per item without cluttering the view. Use tooltips or expandable sections for details.

Feedback: Provide clear visual confirmation for actions like copying to clipboard ("Copied!"), deleting items, or saving settings. Show loading indicators during searches or data fetching.

Error Handling: Display user-friendly error messages (e.g., "Could not connect to history service," "AI categorization failed for this item").

7. Technical Specifications

Frontend:

Framework: Browser Extension Manifest V3.

Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+). No specific JS framework mandated, but recommend lightweight options if used (e.g., Preact, or vanilla JS).

Permissions: storage, clipboardRead, activeTab, scripting, alarms (for periodic cleanup/tasks), favicon (optional).

Communication: Use fetch API to communicate with the backend over HTTPS.

Backend:

Framework: Express.js (Node.js).

Language: JavaScript/TypeScript.

AI Integration: Use official Google AI SDK/Client Library for Node.js to interact with the gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-experimental-01-21 model via its API. Securely manage API keys. Implement robust error handling and retry logic for API calls.

API: RESTful API design. Endpoints include:

POST /api/v1/items: Add a new clipboard item.

GET /api/v1/items: Retrieve clipboard items (with pagination, filtering, searching parameters).

DELETE /api/v1/items/:id: Delete a specific item.

DELETE /api/v1/items: Delete all items for the user.

PUT /api/v1/items/:id/favorite: Toggle favorite status.

(Internal endpoint/trigger for AI categorization, likely integrated into the POST /items flow)

Database:

Type: MongoDB.

Schema (Items Collection):

_id: ObjectId (Primary Key)

userId: String (Indexed, Unique anonymous ID from extension)

content: String (or Binary for images)

contentType: String ('text' | 'image') (Indexed)

sourceUrl: String

sourceTitle: String

category: String (Indexed, e.g., 'Code Snippet', 'URL', 'Image', 'Uncategorized')

isFavorite: Boolean (Indexed)

createdAt: Date (Indexed, TTL index can be used for time-based expiry)

contentHash: String (Optional: hash of content to aid deduplication if desired)

Project Structure:

extension/: Contains all Manifest V3 extension code (manifest.json, background.js, popup/, content_scripts/, etc.).

backend/: Contains all Express.js backend code (server.js, routes/, models/, controllers/, services/, etc.).

Image Storage: Store smaller images directly in MongoDB as Base64 strings or Binary data. For larger images, consider storing them in a separate object storage (like S3 or equivalent) and storing only the URL in MongoDB to keep DB size manageable (though this adds complexity - for the "final" version without future scope, storing directly in Mongo might be acceptable up to Mongo's document size limits, acknowledging the trade-off). Decision: Store directly in MongoDB as Binary/BSON type for simplicity, accepting the document size limitation (16MB).

8. Release Criteria

All Functional Requirements (Section 4) are implemented and verified through testing.

All Non-Functional Requirements (Section 5) related to performance, reliability, and security are met based on defined metrics.

The extension passes review for the target browser(s) web store (e.g., Chrome Web Store).

No critical or major bugs identified in the final round of QA testing.

User interface is polished and adheres to the UX guidelines (Section 6).

Basic user documentation (Help/FAQ section, Privacy Policy) is complete and accessible.

Backend infrastructure is deployed and configured for production load.

9. Future Considerations

As per the requirement ("don't leave anything for the future"), this document describes the complete feature set for the final product version 1.0. No features are intentionally deferred.

10. Open Issues

Precise prompt engineering for the Gemini API needs refinement during development to ensure optimal categorization accuracy across diverse content types.

Final UI design mockups to be created based on UX considerations.
